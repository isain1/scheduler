# Work Day Scheduler

The point of this project is to create an application that displays the wours of a typical work day and allows the user to input events into certain hours to work as a planner for the user. On top of that the users input can then be saved to the local storage so that when the page is refreshed the users input will still be displayed. 

This application is dynamically powered using API's like bootstrap, JQuery, Moment.js, and Fontawesome.
